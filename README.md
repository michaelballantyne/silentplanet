Silent Planet Text Adventure
=
Text adventure game created as a software engineering class project with Daniel Tanner, Matthew Castillo and Jonathan Bradbury.

Implemented as a couchapp, with client side relying on Sammy.js. The engine has some ugliness but works ok. The content was never quite finished.

Usage
-
Requires couchdb and the couchapp python tool installed. Then change into the app directory and run `couchapp push <servername>/<dbname>`. Visit the app at <servername>/<dbname>/_design/app/index.html. 

There is a default admin account with username 'admin' and password 'admin'.
