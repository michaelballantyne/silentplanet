As you look into the portal you can see what appears to be a space ship.  Since there is no way out of the room you decide to go through the portal.  At first you just stick your hand through.  You don't notice any harm comming to your hand so you decide to step all the way through.  Instantly your world turns upside down and sideways.  You are spinning out of control but when you exit through the other way your strangely not dizzy at all.  You can clearly see where you are and where you are is a space station.",
