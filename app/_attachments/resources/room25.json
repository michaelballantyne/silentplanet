Try to avoid getting eaten by a plant.  That would suck.  As you look around at the array of colors you find that something catches your eye.  On one of the plants that would eat you if given the chance there is some sparkling soil.  You need this magic soil but you must be very cautious.  Solve a problem to sneek by the plant and get the magic soil.",
