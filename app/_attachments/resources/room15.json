There is a brick wall to the west and you need a rest so you head to the wall and lean up against it.  Oops! The brick that you leaned up against moved slightly when you put your weight against it.  This intrigues you. So you try to push it but it won't budge any more. Perhaps if you solve a problem you might be able to move it. What will you try to do?  Will you try to solve the question or will you go back down the way you came.  There are two ways down.  The stairs or the ladder. What will you do?",
