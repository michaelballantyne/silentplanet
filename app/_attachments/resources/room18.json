This is a dirt tunnel and is very dark.  You can't see anything so you feel your way through the tunnel.  As you travel through the tunnel you start to see a faint light. You head towards the light.  Things get brighter and brighter untill you see that there is an exit up ahead.  You go to the exit of the tunnel and enter another room.",
