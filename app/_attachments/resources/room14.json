This room is masive but there is nothing in it except 6 ceiling fans that cover the size of the room to keep it cool.  This room is huge. Expecially for a person of your 4 inch size. In this room there is only one way to go and that is up. There is a ladder that heads to what appears to be a loft. You can only go two directions. Up, or down. Which way will you choose.",
