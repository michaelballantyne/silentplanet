You want to go see all the unique weapons in this room when something catches your eye.  Sitting up on a shelf is a vile.  You recognize this item and you must have it because you know it will help you get back to full size.  However, it is too hight to reach.  You must climb but in order to climb you must solve a problem.  After you solve the problem and get the vile you try to find a way to escape this room and continue on your journey.",
